print("QUESTION:\n At what size of a project should you start using version management software? Why?")
print("ANSWER:\n You should start using a version management system (VMS) as soon as you start a project, regardless of what size the final product is intended to be. It helps with keeping code organized so that it is not a mess, it helps to have a back up of former versions of your project just in case an update breaks something so you can go back and look at where the potential problem area is, and it also helps track progress from your very first version to the final version to give you what is essentially a digital scrapbook of where you started and the changes your project has gone through along the way. It also serves as a way for other programmers (or your teachers) to sort of think through your code with you, so that they can witness your thought process behind certain coding decisions and certain aspects of the project.")
